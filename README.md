### 4. **E-commerce Cart Add-On Conversion Forecast**
- **Goal**: Predict the conversion rate for adding non-medical items to the cart and evaluate the potential impact of a proposed feature change on the e-commerce platform.
- **Tech Stack**: SQL, Python, Time Series Analysis, Augmented Dickey-Fuller Test
- **Results**: Forecast shows conversion rate reaching 20% in 3 months, with an upward trend correlated to revenue gains. The proposed feature change by the Product Team could accelerate this trend by increasing visibility of non-medical items during checkout.
- **Details**: [Report](/cart-add-ons-feature.pdf)
